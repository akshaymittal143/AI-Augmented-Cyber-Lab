  abstract: >-
    Modern software development is increasingly driven by cloud-native technologies, 
    yet cybersecurity education has not kept pace. Traditional training environments 
    often rely on static, pre-configured labs that fail to capture the complexity of 
    real-world cloud infrastructures or adapt to individual learner needs. This paper 
    presents an AI-augmented cyber lab that integrates semantic artifact analysis via 
    Large Language Models (LLMs), adaptive pedagogical control via Reinforcement Learning (RL), 
    and realistic threat simulation into a unified, event-driven learning platform. 
    The system achieves 92% F1-score in security analysis and demonstrates effective 
    adaptive scaffolding for cloud-native security education.
