  A comprehensive educational platform integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), 
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents, and realistic threat simulation for 
  cloud-native security training. Achieves 94% accuracy in security analysis
  and provides adaptive pedagogical scaffolding for cybersecurity education.

    Modern software development is increasingly driven by cloud-native technologies, 
    yet cybersecurity education has not kept pace. This paper presents an AI-augmented 
    cyber lab that integrates semantic artifact analysis via Large Language Models (LLMs), 
    adaptive pedagogical control via Reinforcement Learning (RL), and realistic threat 
    simulation into a unified, event-driven learning platform. The system achieves 94% 
    accuracy in security analysis and demonstrates effective adaptive scaffolding for 
    cloud-native security education.
